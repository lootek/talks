# talks

This repo contains the slide decks made using [Go present](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present) tool.
That is they're compatible with the official [Go talks looks and format](https://go.dev/talks/) with all the added benefits like the ability to Go play the code from inside the slide.

### NOTE
You can render these slide decks locally by invoking `present` from the top=level directory of this repo and visiting http://127.0.0.1:3999 in your browser.
